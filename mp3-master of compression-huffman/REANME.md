compress file using huffman tree.

You can set name of the file to compress by changing string variable named "input_filename" at "main.cpp".
then "re_***your input file name***" will be generated; It is the compressed file.
after that "re_re_***your input file name***" will be generated; It is decompressed file from the compressed file.
